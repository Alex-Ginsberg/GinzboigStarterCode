# Spot-Me

*The smart way for groups to make Spotify playlists.*

Spot-Me is a Spotify integrated chat app that allows users to form groups with their friends and create playlists together. By forming a 'music-group', a playlist for that group will be added to the members' Spotify accounts. Members can then communicate and share music through Spot-Me. When a shared song receives a certain amount of likes, (specified by the music-group admin) the song will automatically be added to the Spotify playlist, creating a playlist that reflects the preferences of the group.
